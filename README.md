- Designed 3 programs in Python and C++ to calculate intersections, generate data, and compute the shortest paths.
- Wrote a driver program in C++ that employs pipes for Inter-Process Communication (IPC) to link the input and
output among three programs, and controls the random input generator via Shell command-prompt.
- Implemented a multi-threaded program consisting of 7 threads: one dedicated to I/O operations, and the other 6
implementing different algorithms to solve the NP vertex cover problem, with runtime testing in a Linux environment.
